# InfoFinderChatbotProject
This repository houses my submission to the [Google Dialogflow CX Competition](https://events.withgoogle.com/dialogflow-cx-competition-global/).
I have created a single-flow chatbot that collects the following input from its user to identify the product information required by the user:
- Product name
- Product version
- Information type

The flow I have designed for my competetion submission can handle the errors made by its user:
- Unrecognized input
- Insufficient input (user does not provide one or two of the above-mention input)
- Partially correct input (user provides only one or two of the above-mention input correctly)
